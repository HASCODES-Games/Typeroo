# Typeroo
A monkeytype-inspired typing/spelling trainer that focuses more on accuracy than on speed.

# How to play
Just put main.py in any interpreter, even an online one. It is also reccomended you add a txt file on your computer with the list of words you'd like to train on. You can load this onto Typeroo instead of manually writing it.

# Dependancies
- tkinter (Already comes with Python on Mac and Windows, but on linux run: sudo apt-get install python3-tk)
- Python (3.10.5 used, but any future version should work)

More coming soon, as right now we're lacking features.

# Notable Features
- File loading for word lists
- Word shuffle
- Blind mode (can't see if you got a word right or wrong)
- Accuracy counter
- Words Per Minute (WPM) counter

# Coming Soon
- Application mode (not in terminal)
- Better way to change settings
- UI and better layout
- Sound on click
